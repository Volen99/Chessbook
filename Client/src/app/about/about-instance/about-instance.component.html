                <li><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</li>
                <li><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Your content will be viewed by other people. Any decision you take will affect your audience, and you should take them into account when making editorial decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.</li>
                <li><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. Itâ€™s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Chessbook community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Chessbook community.</li>
                <li><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose.</strong> Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
                        <li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
                        <li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").</li>
                        <li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
                        <li>Accusing someone of cheating publicly without being proven.</li>
                        <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
                        <li>Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why.</strong> Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Chessbook is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. Some like starting with 1.e4 some with 1.d4 etc.. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesnâ€™t mean that theyâ€™re wrong. Donâ€™t forget that it is human to blunder and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</li>
